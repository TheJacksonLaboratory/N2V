15074717	2004	Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignant tumour in humans and most occur in elderly people. The pathogenesis of BCC is directly related to exposure to ultraviolet radiation in sunlight, but trauma is also mentioned occasionally. As well as one published series, several single cases have been reported. Our aim in the present study was to assess any possible relation between the development of BCC and trauma in a series of 92 patients, 12 of whom (13%) gave a history of previous injury. These lesions either developed directly after a sharp or blunt injury or in the scar tissue that had resulted from previous surgical incisions, burns, or dog bites. The male:female ratio was higher in the injured group (10:2) than in the uninjured group (44:36), but not significantly so (p = 0.11). Morphoea-like basal cell carcinomas were more common in the injured group (n = 91) (p = 0.06). We conclude that trauma might be considered as another aetiological agent for BCC.
15074724	2004	Two consecutive mandibular reconstructions with free vascularised fibular grafts in a patient with gingival cancers are presented. After resection of a gingival cancer on the left side, reconstruction was performed with a free vascularised fibular graft from the left leg. Two-and-a-half years later, a second free vascularised osteoseptocutaneous fibular graft from the right leg was used to reconstruct the right mandible and floor of the mouth after resection of a new gingival cancer. The two flaps have reconstructed the mandible from angle-to-angle. During the second reconstruction, a deviation of the left neomandible to the right side was corrected. Both postoperative courses were uneventful. Donor site morbidity was negligible, and the osteosyntheses healed well. This result further emphasises the value of the free fibular flap and the importance of adequate contouring of the fibular graft with osteotomies.
15074729	2004	The Grand Round was held at the Christie Hospital, Manchester, U.K., on 30 November 2002. It followed a presentation by Dr David Dearnaley from the Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton on 'Novel approaches and trials in prostate cancer'. Controversies in the management of locally advanced prostate cancer were illustrated by a case presentation and followed by a discussion on the evaluation of disease extent, and the roles of radiotherapy and hormone ablation.
15074730	2004	Transperineal interstitial prostate brachytherapy is increasingly available to patients with early prostate cancer in the U.K., but limited data are available about the toxicity and early results in the U.K. prostate cancer population. We describe our experience and results from prostate brachytherapy to date. Two hundred and fifty-five patients were treated at St Luke's Cancer Centre, Guildford, U.K., between March 1999 and November 2002. Of these, over 3 months of follow-up data were available for 216 patients. Patients were assessed at 6 weeks and then at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after implant, and at 6 monthly intervals thereafter. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and toxicity, including catheter use, was recorded prospectively. Median PSA at 1, 2 and 3 years was 0.5, 0.4 and 0.1 ng/ml, respectively. Ninety-five per cent of patients experienced temporary deterioration in their urinary symptoms, which persisted at clinically significant levels (IPSS increase >3 points) for 9 months after implant. The severity of urinary symptoms (IPSS) after implant was most closely related to IPSS at presentation (P<0.001). Acute urinary retention (AUR) occurred in 20 (9.3%) patients, with a further 26 (12.1%) patients using clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC) to reduce voiding frequency associated with chronic retention. Median duration of catheter use was 4 weeks. Multivariate analysis revealed that urodynamic status, prostate volume and IPSS score were independently significant (P<0.05) predictors of post-implant catheter use. Twelve patients (5.6%) reported either rectal urgency or mild, self-limiting rectal bleeding. Brachytherapy was tolerated well, with self-limiting urinary, bowel and sexual toxicity in most patients. Postoperative catheter use in our population is closely linked to pre-implant IPSS score, baseline prostate volume and urodynamic obstruction status. This work confirms the prognostic value of urodynamic assessment, which adds useful prognostic information to assessment of known risk factors such as prostate volume and IPSS.
15074731	2004	Metastases to the prostate gland are rare and often found in the context of widespread metastatic disease. We report an unusual case of primary gastric signet ring cell adenocarcinoma (SRCC) diagnosed over 1 year after treatment for metastatic disease in the prostate.
15074734	2004	To study the toxicity profile and effectiveness of combination of trastuzumab and docetaxel in women with metastatic breast cancer showing HER-2 overexpression (IHC 3+). Sixteen women with metastatic breast cancer were treated with trastuzumab (2 mg/kg every week) and docetaxel (100 mg/m2) as first-line therapy. A loading dose of 4 mg/kg trastuzumab was given on week 1. We planned to give a minimum of six cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy. A total of 89 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy was given (median five cycles per patient). Median number of cycles of trastuzumab was 44 with a range of 20-71. Of the 16 patients, seven (44%) had complete response (CR), whereas five patients (31%) had partial response (PR). The overall response rate (CR+PR) was 75%. Two patients died of progressive disease, and the other two died at home, for which the cause of death could not be known. No anaphylaxis, cardio-toxicity or febrile neutropenia was observed in any patient. Overall, the toxicity was within tolerable limits. The combination of trastuzumab and docetaxel in women with metastatic breast cancer showing HER-2 overexpression (IHC 3+) is a safe and effective regimen. However, further randomised trials are needed to establish its role in metastatic breast cancer.
15074735	2004	To compare the metastatic pattern at presentation and the prognosis with metastases of 48 patients with carcinomas with tubular features (45 tubular mixed and three pure tubular) and 302 patients with tumours of ductal of no special type (DNST). We carried out a retrospective study from a prospectively maintained database of all patients who developed metastatic disease from carcinoma of the breast in Nottingham, U.K., since 1997. We recorded site of first presentation with metastatic disease, radiological features, histological features and characteristics of the primary tumour. The group of patients with tubular features were older at metastatic presentation (63.9 years vs 59.6 years; P=0.012), had a longer disease-free interval (87 months vs 34 months: P<0.001) and a longer survival with metastases (P<0.002). This group were less likely to have liver metastases (23% vs 41%; P=0.028), in particular multiple liver metastases (50% vs 71%; P=0.015) than the patients with DNST. Other factors known to be associated with prolonged survival, such as low histological grade of the primary invasive tumour and positive oestrogen receptor (ER) status, were more common in the group of patients with tumours with tubular features (Grade 1: 33% vs 3%; Grade 2: 42% vs 25%; Grade 3: 25% vs 72%; P<0.001), (ER positivity 76% vs 52%; P=0.009). When patients with grade 2 tumours were compared, the age at metastatic presentation, disease-free interval and the presence of multiple liver metastases were still significantly different between the two groups. Patients with metastatic breast carcinoma with tubular features have a longer survival with metastases than patients with metastatic DNST carcinoma. This improved survival can be explained by better well-recognised prognostic features, such as metastatic site pattern, histological grade, ER status and disease-free interval.
15074736	2004	Familial cases of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) are rare, and have all been described in patients with the classical variant of the disease. The predisposition of classical Kaposi's sarcoma among Jews is well known. We herein describe five families, all Jews, in which two members have Kaposi's sarcoma. To our knowledge, this has been the largest reported series of familial Kaposi's sarcoma. The clinical course, management and response to therapy were described and compared with other published cases. No similarity was found in any of the families in time and age of onset of the disease, or in the severity and course of the disease among the members of the same family. There was a high incidence of second neoplasms among these familial cases. We discuss the potential implications of second neoplasms based on our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, as well as the influence or predisposal of some genetic mechanisms to the development of Kaposi's sarcoma.
15074737	2004	This study evaluates the consequences of point A as a dose prescription point during multiple high-dose-rate (HDR) intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) in cancer cervix. Fifty patients who had received teletherapy were randomised into two groups of 25 to receive three HDR ICBT fractions of 6 Gy each at point A with either a flexible Ralstron (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) or rigid Rotterdam (Nucletron, Netherlands) applicator. The orthogonal radiographs of the 150 applications were evaluated for applicator geometry and point A co-ordinates. Irrespective of the nature and rigidity of the applicators, its various components exhibited a highly significant variation during multiple fractionated HDR ICBT. The Cartesian co-ordinates of point A (left and right) for the applicator geometry also showed significant variation during multiple HDR ICBT procedures. This resulted in an average shift of 9.5 mm (SD= +/-4.4) and 11.1 mm (SD= +/-6.4) in right point A, 10.2 mm (SD= +/-4.5) and 10.8 mm (SD= +/-6.6) in left point A for Ralstron and Rotterdam applicator, respectively, during the three HDR ICBT. Consequently, doses to both right and left point A's showed significant variation during multiple ICBT application and were independent of the applicator type. Applicator variation in the components and spatial position in the pelvis during multiple HDR ICBT results in multiple point A's irrespective of the nature of applicator, leading to uncertainty in the dose prescription. These uncertainties, which have a bearing on clinical end points, could be minimised by shifting from point-based dose prescription to image-based target localisation and treatment planning in ICBT.
15074738	2004	As the trend towards more conformal treatment continues, the accuracy of treatment delivery becomes more important. Conventionally, treatment set-up for prostate cancer patients is verified in relation to the bony anatomy. However, there can be prostate movement independent of bony anatomy. This study tested the feasibility of using Beam cath to enable online correction of treatment set-up in relation to the prostate position, and to assess inter-fraction and intra-fraction prostate movement. Beam cath is a urethral catheter containing radio-opaque markers, which can be seen on electronic portal imaging, enabling verification of prostate rather than bony anatomy position. The Beam cath was used for planning and treatment of a boost phase of 10 Gy in 5 fractions, delivered before the conventional conformal plan of 60 Gy in 30 fractions. Patients were scanned by computed tomgography (CT), with and without the catheter, and a radio-opaque marker in the catheter was used as the isocentre of the boost phase to enable accurate and rapid pre-treatment isocentre adjustment. The set-up errors between the Beam Cath and bony images were compared to identify the magnitude of prostate movement, independent of bony anatomy. Post-treatment portal images were taken to assess intra-fraction prostate movement. Of 29 patients approached to take part in the study, 18 patients gave informed consent, but only five completed the intended 5 fractions of the boost phase using Beam cath. Pre- and post-treatment portal images were obtained for a total of 29 fractions in six patients. Inter-fraction prostate movement, independent of bony anatomy, was identified. The mean movements were 0.2 mm (standard deviation [SD] 1.2 mm), 2.9 mm (SD 3.1 mm) and 0.7 mm (SD 2.3 mm) in the right left (RL), cranio-caudal (CC) and anterior posterior (AP) direction, respectively. The mean intra-fraction movement was 0.2 mm (SD 1.2 mm), 2.9 mm (SD 3.1 mm) and 0.7 mm (SD 2.3 mm) in the RL, CC and AP direction, respectively. Although independent prostate movement was identified, the use of Beam cath was poorly tolerated. Alternative methods of identifying and correcting for prostate movement should be investigated.
